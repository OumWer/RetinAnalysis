# RetinAnalysis
RetinAnalysis uses a fine-tuned CLIP model to classify retinal conditions like Wet AMD, Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative), Cataracts, Hypertensive Retinopathy, and Pathological Myopia. It also performs image similarity analysis, assisting ophthalmologists with fast, accurate diagnoses for retinal diseases.
